Welcome.

The prompt for Round 4 is:

You're a master Pokémon trainer that is striving to catch all of the Pokémon in the world. You have just one more Pokémon to catch: the legendary Arceus. You find where it is, and battle it. After a while, you defeat Arceus. You reach for your Poké Ball, only to find that your bag is completely empty. There's no more empty Poké Balls to use, and you've ran out of money to spend on Poké Balls. In a rush, you figure out a better solution.

What is this solution?
